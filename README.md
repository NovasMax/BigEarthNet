# BigEarthNet Deep Learning Models With TensorFlow
This repository contains code to use deep learning models, pre-trained on the [BigEarthNet archive](http://bigearth.net/) with TensorFlow, to train new models, and to evaluate pre-trained models. Note that in addition to original BigEarthNet labels (will be called `original` in the code), there is a new class nomenclature (will be called `BigEarthNet-19` in the code). This repository is compatible with both options.

* For original BigEarthNet labels, it is highly recommended to first check the [BigEarthNet Deep Learning Models repository](https://gitlab.tu-berlin.de/rsim/bigearthnet-models). 

* For BigEarthNet-19 labels, it is highly recommended to first check the [BigEarthNet-19 Deep Learning Models repository](https://gitlab.tu-berlin.de/rsim/bigearthnet-19-models).

## Prerequisites
* The definitions of ResNet and VGG models are based on their TensorFlow-Slim implementations. Thus, you need to first download the `nets` folder of [TensorFlow-Slim repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim/nets) to the root folder.
* The `prep_splits.py` script from [here](https://gitlab.tu-berlin.de/rsim/bigearthnet-models/blob/master/prep_splits.py) for original labels and the `prep_splits_BigEarthNet-19.py` script from [here](https://gitlab.tu-berlin.de/rsim/bigearthnet-19-models/blob/master/prep_splits.py) for BigEarthNet-19 labels generate `TFRecord` files for train, validation and test sets from the BigEarthNet archive. To train or evaluate any model, required TFRecord files should be first prepared. 
* Config files of each model, which was used to train corresponding model, are given under `configs` folder. If you want to use those config files, you need to download pre-trained model weights and move to the folders (whose paths are written in the corresponding JSON file). 
* TensorFlow package should be installed. All codes are tested with Python 2.7, TensorFlow 1.3 and Ubuntu 16.04. 

## Training
The script `train.py` expects a `JSON` configuration file path as a comand line argument. This file contains the following parameters:
* `model_name`: The name of the Python code containing the corresponding deep learning model. The code must be located under the `models` directory. The model class will be loaded dynamically based on the `model_name` parameter: `model = importlib.import_module('models.' + args['model_name']).dnn_model(nb_class)`
* `label_type`: A flag to indicate which labels will be used during training: `original` or `BigEarthNet-19`
* `batch_size`: Batch size used during training
* `nb_epoch`: The number of epochs for the training
* `learning_rate`: The initial learning rate
* `out_dir`: The path where all log files and checkpoints will be saved.
* `save_checkpoint_after_iteration`: The iteration after which checkpoint saving should start, i.e., no checkpoints are saved before. Set to zero to always have checkpoints saved.
* `save_checkpoint_per_iteration`: The number of iterations per which a checkpoint is written, i.e., when `iteration_index % save_checkpoint_per_iteration == 0`.
* `tr_tf_record_files`: An array containing `TFRecord` file(s) for training.
* `val_tf_record_files`: An array containing `TFRecord` file(s) for validation (not used for now).
* `fine_tune`: A flag to indicate if the training of the model will continue from the existing checkpoint whose path will be defined by `pretrained_model_path`.
* `model_file`: The base name of a pre-trained model snapshot (i.e., checkpoint).
* `shuffle_buffer_size`: The number of elements which will be shuffled at the beginning of each epoch. It is not recommended to have large shuffle buffer if you don't have enough space in memory. 
* `training_size`: The size of the training set. If you are using training set suggested in [here](https://gitlab.tu-berlin.de/rsim/bigearthnet-models/), it is already set.

## Evaluation
The script `eval.py` expects a `JSON` configuration file. The needed parameters are as follows:
* `model_name`: The name of the Python code containing the corresponding deep learning model. The code must be located under the `models` directory. The model class will be loaded dynamically based on the `model_name` parameter: `model = importlib.import_module('models.' + args['model_name']).dnn_model(nb_class)`
* `batch_size`: Batch size used during evaluation
* `out_dir`: The path where all log files and checkpoints will be saved.
* `test_tf_record_files`: An array containing `TFRecord` files for evaluation.
* `model_file`: The base name of a pre-trained model snapshot (i.e., checkpoint).
* `test_size`: The size of the test set. If you are using test set suggested in [here](https://gitlab.tu-berlin.de/rsim/bigearthnet-models/), it is already set.
